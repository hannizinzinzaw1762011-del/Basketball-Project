    <h1>All About The Basketball (Webpage Assignment By Room-3)</h1>
    <h3>Yadanar, Yoon Thiri, Chan Myae, Han Ni</h3>

    <h2>What is Basketball?</h2>
    <p>
      Basketball is a dynamic team sport played by two teams of five players. The primary objective is to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent’s elevated hoop, which is 10 feet (3.048 m) high. The game is played on a rectangular court, and players advance the ball by dribbling or passing it. The team that accumulates the most points by the end of the game is declared the winner.
    </p>

    <h2>History of Basketball</h2>
    <p>
      Basketball was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. He was tasked with creating a new indoor sport that was less prone to injury than football. The first games were played using a soccer ball and two peach baskets as hoops, with a set of 13 basic rules. The sport quickly gained popularity, spreading across the United States and eventually worldwide.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
    <p>
      The rules of basketball are designed to ensure fair and organized play. Each team has five players on the court at a time. The game involves advancing the ball by either dribbling (bouncing the ball on the floor) or passing to a teammate. Players are prohibited from running with the ball without dribbling. A shot made from inside the three-point line is worth two points, while a shot from outside the three-point line is worth three points. Fouls are called for illegal contact, which can result in free throws or possession for the opposing team. The team with the most points when time expires wins the game.
    </p>

    <h2>Court and Equipment</h2>
    <p>
      A regulation basketball court is 28 meters long and 15 meters wide. It is marked with a center line, a center circle, free-throw lines, and a three-point line. Indoor courts are typically made of polished wood, while outdoor courts can be concrete or asphalt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The essential equipment includes a basketball, a round ball used for the game, and hoops with backboards mounted 10 feet high at each end of the court. Players wear uniforms consisting of a jersey and shorts, and specialized basketball shoes are worn for support and grip.
